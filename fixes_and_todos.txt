w.r.t. previous data:
- "xfmr_29" not found. current workaround: comment line 212-213 of parse_network.jl

TODO?
- find a better name/data picker now that we have multiple days to choose from?
- fix isnan(\sigma) in build_dst and also isnan(m1,m2,m3...) where do these NaNs come from? they look like zeros
- remove transformers with no LV-side measurements
