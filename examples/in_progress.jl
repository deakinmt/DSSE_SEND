    Arguments:
    - math: mathemetical model dictionary in use
    - path: path to the csv file where the transformer loading and rating are available

    The scope is to assigns pseudomeasurements for those non-measured users for which an 
        estimate of the transformer loading is available.
    The pseudo-measurement corresponds to the product of the transformer rating and loading,
    and as such it is time-invariant. The standard deviation of the pseudo-measurement is 100x
    larger than that of a regular power measurement.
    #ND THIS FUNCTION IS NOT finished, we decided to add only variable bounds atm!
