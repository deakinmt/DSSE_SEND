- how do you run powerflows? balanced demand per phase?                 -> nothing is run yet
- some substations are measured on mv (11.x), some lv (0.4x)?           -> evidently
- some substations don't have a "lv" load, but there is power injection -> being checked
- ss17 has constant measurement values and no flag.?                    -> being checked
- you deliberately send 13 hours?                                       -> yes, there's no 12/24 hr problem
- ss02 lots of nans, the _qos is also weird. furthermore, no load or gen name "ss02" in the data. -> being checked
- also no "ss11", "ss12", "ss25", "ss29" in the load data (yes in the measurements) -> being checked
- same "ss13" (but that's maybe generator voltage source)               -> being checked
- storage: i1 always zero, always flagged                               -> being checked
- ss19: v1 flat, no flag                                                -> being checked
- ss13_1 vs ss13_2? what's the difference? how to treat them for the DSSE?  -> one is just a bus (connection point is open), with voltage meas. the other is a SS
- how do they know that the impedance is off? you can't really run a full unbalanced power flow with what you have.. -> they don't run pf. impedance models being checked

- it seems that the measurement channels on the MV side are aligned (nice!)
- for the LV measurements, maybe it is impossible to tell, because they refer to different networks with different loadings
  and different tap settings? or do transfos all have the same tap settings? (seems so by data) -> being checked
  - if same taps, then just assume the channels are not aligned, and assign the phases depending on the average voltage value? -> it is a possibility

- measurements from nodes 30 and/or 1 (in the bitpaper) would be handy, to compare hv/lv on the same point -> being checked
  also, any reason why they're not saved?

- assuming that the tap settings are correctly known and modelled, as well as transfo power losses, we actually can make do with
  measurements on the LV side only. (equality constraints of transfos bind the LV and MV vars) 
  but we also need to know if the LV channels are aligned to the MV channels.

- ss29 is measured but ss29 does not even exist as a bus. where will it be?
- ss33 ib the bitpaper, but nowhere to be found on data --> close to ss29. they were left out? missing branch/loop?
- ss02 does have a bus, but I left it out because meas is always NaN
- negative measurements = power generation? some ss occasionally inject power. possible?
      but then it does not explain why "wind" is positive while "solar" is negative. what is the convention?
